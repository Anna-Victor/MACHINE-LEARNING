A Bioinformatics Study for Identifying Potential Biomarkers for Ovarian Cancer


The current research was aimed in identifying candidate genes to be used as biomarkers for the development and progression of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC).

Candidate genes associated with the development and progression of Ovarian Carcinoma were obtained and verified using bioinformatic analysis carried out on 2 Microarray datasets namely: GSE14407 and GSE54388 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database.
